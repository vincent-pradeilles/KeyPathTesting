## Context

KeyPathTesting is a Swift framework that leverages Result Builders to implement a new syntax that allows developers to write KeyPath-based unit tests.

Here's an example of how it can be used:

```swift
class MyTests: XCTestCase {
    func test() {
        let myData = [1, 2, 3, 4]
        
        assert(on: myData) {
            \.isEmpty == false
            \.count > 2
            \.first == 1
            \.last != 1
        }
    }
}
```

## How does it work?

I've made a video to explain in details the internal implementation of `KeyPathTesting` ðŸ‘‡

## Requirements

Xcode 12.5 & Swift 5.4

## Installation

### SPM

#### Package.swift

Add a new dependency to your package by adding the following to `Package.swift`:

```
.package(url: "https://github.com/vincent-pradeilles/KeyPathTesting", from: "0.0.1"),
```

#### Xcode

Open your project file in the project navigator and select the project instead of one of your targets. Switch to the Swift Packages tab and click the plus.
When prompted enter the url `https://github.com/vincent-pradeilles/KeyPathTesting`

### CocoaPods

Add the following to your `Podfile`:

`pod "KeyPathTesting"`

### Carthage

Add the following to your `Cartfile`:

`github "vincent-pradeilles/KeyPathTesting" == 0.1.4` 

Please note that newer versions of this framework do not officially support Carthage anymore
